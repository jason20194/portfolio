## Features and Functionality

Here are a list of features and functionality which my developer portfolio site covers:

- There is a navigation bar at the top of the website to direct users to which page they want to go to. If they are lost they can simply press the homepage button which is the Logo on the top left of the website.
- When the screen shrinks, so will the text and images for users who have smaller screens to also be able to view the content without it breaking.
- Added effects of the pages. The introduction text flashes.
- Hover effects also added. For navigation bar once you hover over the page u selected will turn from blue to white, making it easier for users to know which page they will be going to.
- Experiences skills page will have icons of experience for that icon (indicates programming languages).
- Project page has images of screenshots of projects that the user can click into to view.
- Blog page has a scroll down bar for reading all blogs.
- Contact page has inbuilt features where if the user doesnt enter anything, it will prompt for the user to input again and will not work until it is filled out. Also if the users email address contains no "@" he or she will not be able to continue.

## Known Issues

Some issues I ran into whilst doing this project was the HTML validator. It said I had a few errors, however I decided to ignore this due to the importance of it. Along with the time constraints, I decided to leave it since it was not a code breaking issue.

Another issue i ran into was I did not media query for every single phone or tablet, since I simply did not have enough time. I did media query for a few screen sizes, however some may not look good when the site is being viewed. So please keep in mind that if it doesnt look good, I most likely did not media query for the screen size it is being viewed on.

Last issue is because my pages arent supported by all browsers, it may not look good in some browsers such as Safari.
